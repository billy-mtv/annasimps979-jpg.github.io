# Status Effects

When a character successfully hits another with a status-inflicting ability, the target or targets of the ability in question are now under the received status effect until they are either cured by an item or ability.  The status effect inflicted by an ability of this type is determined by its elemental type.  Unlike damaging abilities, elemental resistances do not change the actual effect of the ability.  Instead, they change the probability that the target will receive the status effect at all.  When a character uses a status-inflicting ability against another character on the battlefield, consult the element table in the last section, with the element associated with the power on the left-hand column and the element of the target on the top.  There is no such thing as a colorless status effect.  The associated multiplier changes the probability as follows:

0.25x.  The target is immune to the status effect.
0.5x.  The status effect is inflicted when the result of the status-inflicting ability roll is 3 or below instead of 5 or below.
2x.  The status effect is inflicted when the result of the status-inflicting ability roll is 7 or below instead of 5 or below.
4x.  The target cannot evade this status effect.

There are nine negative status effects that player abilities can inflict, one for each elemental type:
*  Fire: Burned.  The affected character cannot receive any healing and cannot be buffed while this status is active.  Any buffs they have already received remain active until otherwise removed.
*  Water: Confused.  When a Confused character uses an ability with a target other than themselves, the GM flips a coin and has them call heads or tails.  If they call correctly, their ability is used on the intended target.  If they call incorrectly, the GM chooses the target of their ability instead.  If an enemy is Confused, the role of the player and GM are reversed.
*  Earth: Petrified.  The affected character is unable to use the Move action, and their base Evasion counts as being half its current value rounded down, not including buffs and debuffs.  They may still advance as normal.
*  Light: Blinded.  The affected character's Physical, Magical, and Status Accuracy count as half their values rounded down, including buffs and debuffs.
*  Ice: Frostbitten.  The affected character is unable to use their basic attack, use items, or use any abilities that restore Health or Mana.  Any abilities they have that heal passively, such as the Priest's Prayer or the Auto Heal equipment power, are not negated by this status effect.
*  Wind: Fatigued.  When the affected character uses an ability that costs MP, the total MP cost they pay to use said ability is doubled.
*  Thunder: Paralyzed.  Any physical attack rolls the character makes automatically fail.  This includes basic attacks or counterattacks due to abilities.
*  Shadow: Silenced.  Any magical attack rolls the character makes automatically fail.  This includes basic attacks or counterattacks due to abilities.
*  Wood: Poisoned.  During the Effect Phase at the end of a round, this character takes damage equal to one tenth of their base maximum HP rounded down with a minimum damage of 1, not counting any buffs or debuffs but still counting modifiers from equipment.
