# Tier 1 Enemies

## Police
The police are deployed against protestors, activists, criminals, and anyone else that the government perceives as threatening the established order.

In combat, police will swap between rounds where they debuff and rounds where they exert maximum force.  During the first round of battle, they will not attack but instead sit there and either inflict status effects, use buffs and debuffs, or just look menacing.

## Goblins
Goblins are sentient woodland creatures that have their own language and culture.  During lean times, they will sometimes resort to raiding human settlements for food and supplies.

In combat, goblins are both bullies and cowards.  They will gang up on the weakest party member they can attack, and will retreat to the back row as soon as they lose their shields.  They are also wicked cunning, and smart enough to exploit magical and physical vulnerabilities (although they do not know the elements of their enemies off the bat).
