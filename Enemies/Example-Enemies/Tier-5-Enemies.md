# Tier 5 Enemies

## Test Subjects
Deep within the labs of the Technomancers, strange creations grow in vats, waiting to be unleashed on the world.

Test subjects without their masters are very much insane.  They will not use any tactics to speak of, but will instead attack at random.  GMs should use this madness to create tension during fights, saving most the powerful abilities for moments where the players will be caught off guard.

## Royal Militia
The Diamond Queen usually enforces her will on her subjects via psychological means, but more direct intervention is occasionally needed.  That's where her militia come in.

Royal Militia are organized, disciplined, and utterly devoted to their task.  They are primarily concerned with survival, as they are skilled at fighting battles of attrition, but only the survival of the whole unit, rather than any one individual.  They will gladly sacrifice themselves to ensure the day is won.
