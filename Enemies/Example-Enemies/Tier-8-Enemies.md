# Tier 8 Enemies

## Angels
The servants of Heaven are just and righteous, but this makes them no less deadly in combat.

Angels will fight fair, but will also fight hard, and to the death.  If they are sent after the players, this means they know their tactics and their weaknesses and are prepared to respond accordingly.

|Final Judgment|Special|2 AP|When the Avenger uses this ability, the GM selects one of their enemies and rolls a 1d10.  If the result is above a 5, the Condemned enemy takes the total amount of damage they have dealt in the battle minus the amount of healing they have received.  It is possible that this result could be negative, in which case they are healed instead.  If the result is a 5 or below, nothing happens.  In either case, however, the Condemned status is removed and cannot be applied to them again for the rest of the battle.|

## Vampires
There are certain undead who are sentient, and feed off of the life energy of the living.  These undead conglomerate together, and therefore are often classified as being members of the same species.

The Thrall, Ghoul, and Spawn are dumb servants who will attack mindlessly.  However, Elite vampires are quite intelligent, and their minions will also engage in more complex tactics with them around.
