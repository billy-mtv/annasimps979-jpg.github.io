# Tier 3 Enemies

## Living Dead
When necromancers or bioengineers create constructs out of dead bodies, these are the creatures that result.

In combat, the living dead are stupid, aggressive, and totally unconcerned with death.  Insofar as they display cunning, it should purely be to create a sense of dramatic tension and to display animus towards the player characters.

## Void Elves
Tall, enigmatic beings who descended one day from the heavens and now lay claim to the entire Earth.

Void elves are powerful combatants, but are also quite arrogant.  As a result, they will fight with intelligence, but will often disregard their enemies' defenses or buffs, assuming that their raw power is enough to prevail.  They will, of course, still debuff their enemies when they want to prove a point.
