# Tier 10 Enemies

## Dragons
The reptilian lords of the sky are extraordinarily long-lived, and guard their accumulated wealth jealously from interlopers.

In combat, the lives of Elite dragons are much more valuable than those of the Normal tier dragon enemies, meaning that the latter will gladly sacrifice themselves for the former.
