# Tier 9 Enemies

## Invaders
Alternate dimensions contain sentients of their own.  While most transdimensional visitors are benign or even benevolent, those that willingly choose to colonize other dimensions often aren't.

Invaders don't follow too many rules in combat, except for one: do whatever the players expect the least at any given time.

## Robots
Advanced artificial minds often enact their will via numerous servitors, some of which are also equipped for battle.

In battle, robots are part of a single hive mind.  Likewise, they should behave as though they are being coordinated by an intelligent mind that sees them merely as pawns to be sacrificed.
