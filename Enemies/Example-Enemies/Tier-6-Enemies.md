# Tier 6 Enemies

## Chaos Elementals
The Elemental Boundary of the cosmos will sometimes leak into the Material Plane.  When it does, aspects of the elements will be "embodied" in elementals.  Elementals are hostile, and quite insane.

There is nothing discernible elementals usually "want."  They simply act on instinct, using powers associated with their given element almost at random.  They won't use any actions in battle other than their abilities, and won't use these abilities in a tactical manner, instead just lashing out at the nearest target.
