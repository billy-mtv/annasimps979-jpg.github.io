# Tier 1 Enemies

## Police
The police are deployed against protestors, activists, criminals, and anyone else that the government perceives as threatening the established order.

In combat, police will swap between rounds where they debuff and rounds where they exert maximum force.  During the first round of battle, they will not attack but instead sit there and either inflict status effects, use buffs and debuffs, or just look menacing.
