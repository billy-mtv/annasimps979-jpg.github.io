# Tier 5 Enemies

## Test Subjects
Deep within the labs of the Technomancers, strange creations grow in vats, waiting to be unleashed on the world.

Test subjects without their masters are very much insane.  They will not use any tactics to speak of, but will instead attack at random.  GMs should use this madness to create tension during fights, saving most the powerful abilities for moments where the players will be caught off guard.
