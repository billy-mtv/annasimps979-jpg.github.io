# Towns

Population: 1,000-10,000 people.  

A _town_ is the next largest type of settlement after a village.  However, what distinguishes a town from a village is not just its size but also its purpose.  The reason why towns exist in the first place is to facilitate commerce, and as a result town residents will often hold jobs that are provided for by the flow of trade rather than the direct production of foodstuffs.  A town's markets and taverns are gathering spaces where craftspeople can sell their goods, farmers can sell their produce, professionals can ply their trades, and ideologues of all sort can attempt to sway people to their causes.  Towns are the best place to find services and learn about local events, but might still be ignorant of world news beyond the broad strokes.  Larger cities will often have clusters of satellite towns near their limits, while in more rural areas the largest settlement will take the form of a single town.

Towns live and die by the trade that flows through them, and much of what is available in town will exist to attract and feed off of it.  Thus, there will not only be at least one tavern and a marketplace, but also very often the presence of religious sites, libraries, hot springs, circuses, and other attractions that serve to funnel human beings into the town.  There may also be a small handful of industries that require more complicated inputs and their associated guilds, such as a mason's guild, an alchemist's guild, or even a mercenary's guild if the need is great.  There will also be gathering spaces for locals, which are usually expanded versions of what can be found in the average village.

GMs should consider the following questions when designing a town:
*  Towns are large enough to accommodate a great deal of complex politics.  What is the latest drama?  Is there a way for the players to get involved, and if so, how?
*  Is there a marketplace, and if not, where are the merchants located?  What are they like?  Are there any rivalries?
*  Many towns will rest on major landmarks or tourist attractions.  Are there any in particular the players could visit?  Are they scams, or could they provide actual benefit to the players?
*  What political actors rule over the town, and what are their needs?  Are they willing to employ adventurers, and if not, what is the reason?
*  Generally, towns will have some sort of protection against being looted.  What sort exist here?  Walls?  A moat?  A garrison of soldiers or guardsmen?
*  Towns require a lot more food than the average village.  What do the people eat here, and how does it affect the experience of being there?  Is there the sound of frying, or woodsmoke?  The stink of fish?  The aroma of baked bread?
