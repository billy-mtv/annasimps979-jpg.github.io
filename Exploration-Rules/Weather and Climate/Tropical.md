Jungles, the summer months in hotter regions, and the wet season on islands are all represented by the Tropical climate.  Equatorial wetlands tend to also have Tropical climates or similar.

Example natural hazards: thick foliage, a leech-filled swamp, a surging river.

Tropical regions are rife with small animals, poisonous plants, dirty water, and microorganisms, all of which are intent on causing the player characters as much misery as possible.  If the characters run out of supplies, they will also receive the Poisoned status effect in addition to an injury due to deprivation.
