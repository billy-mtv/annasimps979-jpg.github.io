Due to the cold, players in Polar regions should always be wearing a Coldproof Cloak or piece of equipment.  Players who are not should roll a 1d4 during each camping phase regardless of the weather.  Each character whose player rolls a 4 will develop the Frostbite status effect.  While traveling through a Polar region, the navigation difficulty of a path is 5 greater than it otherwise would be according to the Nodes and Paths section due to the effects of snow blindness, ice, snow, and the shifting of the ground.
