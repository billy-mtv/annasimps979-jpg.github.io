# Last Odyssey SRD

The following is the System Reference Document for my in-development FRP (TTRPG for the nerds reading this), Last Odyssey.  My intention is to turn this game into a Kickstarter and then a sellable hardcover/pdf with nice art and a narrative structure, but the game is playable with just these rules.  I consider what is in here right now to be an "open beta" in the sense that anyone can pick up and play it, but what is in here now

## Blurb

*The horizon stretches out before you, vast, indifferent, and unending.  It is your trial to venture forth, towards that place where the sky meets the earth; to grow strong, to explore distant lands, to defeat evil wherever it may be found.  You will burn bright, fight hard, laugh loudly in the face of danger, and, when the time comes, sacrifice yourself for something worth dying for.*

Last Odyssey is a game that is about translating the experience of playing a JRPG into tabletop--a TTJRPG, to borrow a turn of phrase.  Like those games, Last Odyssey is about taking risks, overcoming fear and anxiety, forging friendships between characters, and journeying into the unknown.

Last Odyssey is a TTJRPG for 3-5 players and a single GM inspired by JRPGs like Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy 13, and Lost Odyssey that explore anxiety, growth, and loss alongside more upbeat themes like discovery, exploration, and the battle between good and evil.  Last Odyssey has a fragmented design structure, with separate systems for combat and travel that serve as the rigid backbone for the more story-driven and rules-lite aspects.  The result is a game that, in the tradition of JRPGs, is more than the sum of its parts.

Last Odyssey has a "trad" TTRPG structure, which its author refers to as FRP, or Facilitated Role Play.  The GM is the arbiter responsible for controlling the world and interpreting the game rules, while each player controls a single, powerful character whose actions earn them experience points that allow them to become more powerful and take on more dangerous challenges.

## Features

* **Team-based tactical combat.**  Each player character has their own unique set of abilities that work in tandem with the abilities of other players to achieve victory.  No character can stand alone, and no character is left behind.
*  **Streamlined exploration and worldbuilding.**  When traveling from place to place, characters will have to deal with both enemy encounters and with the natural world.  Simple mechanics like weather effects, navigation rolls, and the node-path system streamline exploration while still creating worlds that feel like real places.
* **Mechanics that emphasize drama.**  The Scenes system rewards players for tempting fate, by asking them to put their relationships, their aspirations, and even their lives at risk in order to gain Anima, which in turn allows them to become more powerful and gain the upper hand in other parts of gameplay.
* **Lethal Antagonists that can manipulate fate.**  Antagonists are not just powerful enemies in combat, but special characters that can take player Anima and throw it right back in their faces.  Villains and Monsters can earn and spend Anima, and are also the only thing in the world that can kill players without their permission, making them terrifying opponents to face down.
* **Elegant creation tools for GMs.**  Last Odyssey is a game by a GM, for GMs.  In addition to mountains of ready-made objects and people to put into your game, Last Odyssey also outlines how GMs can easily create their own enemies and items to both challenge and reward players in ways that keep the game feeling fresh, even for veterans.
* **Acquiring knowledge and secret Lore.**  Investigation and Lore mechanics resolve player information-gathering in ways that align character knowledge with player knowledge.  There is no such thing as a failed knowledge check--instead, players are encouraged to be curious and meet the world on its own terms.
* **Spiting death, and dying well.**  In Last Odyssey, player characters are normally insulated from death, encouraging a sense of fearlessness.  However, at critical moments, they may risk dying for the sake of earning Anima, and Antagonists may kill them permanently if the opportunity presents itself.
* **A balance between free and structured play.**  Last Odyssey is "rules-heavy" in some places and "rules-lite" in others.  Its free parts and its structured parts are strictly delineated in a way that makes it easier to run and also supports multiple kinds of play.
Forging bonds between players.  It's not just combat where player characters are forced to cooperate.  Player characters truly need one another when facing down danger.  They treat each other's wounds, carry each other's burdens, and have each other's back when it counts.
