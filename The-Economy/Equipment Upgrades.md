# Equipment Upgrades

In addition to buying new equipment, players can also purchase the addition or removal of upgrades for existing equipment by paying a professional who specializes in doing so.  To remove an upgrade from a piece of equipment costs 100 cr times the total Upgrade Value it takes up on the equipment.  To add an upgrade to a piece of equipment costs an amount of cr equal to the difference between what the equipment would cost with the upgrade and what the equipment would cost without it, plus 500 cr, 1000 cr, or 5000 cr if the upgrade has an Upgrade Value of 1, 2, or 3, respectively.  Regardless of how it's done, upgrading a piece of equipment is a painstaking process, and might take multiple days or even weeks to accomplish.  Professionals capable of producing precisely the upgrade that players want should also be rare, and finding one might be a side quest if the GM deems it appropriate.
