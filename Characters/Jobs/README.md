# Jobs

The job a character currently occupies determines their role in combat.  While they occupy a job, they may use any of the abilities that you have unlocked via character advancement except for the capstone ability, which can only be used by their eidolon.  Any of the unlocked passive abilities for a job, such as Trained Spellcaster, only apply if the character currently occupies the job.  In addition, they gain extra bonuses to three different statistics equal to their three attributes.

In Last Odyssey, there are six distinct jobs:
*  [Striker](Striker)
*  [Caster](Caster)
*  [Healer](Healer)
*  [Defender](Defender)
*  [Support](Support)
*  [Saboteur](Saboteur)
