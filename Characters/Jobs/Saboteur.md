*  Their Evasion is increased by an amount equal to their Spirit.

Abilities by Rank:

**Rank 1:** Debuff. Ranged. Cost: 3 MP, 1 AP.  Move an enemy down one level on the Bonus Tracker for the statistic that your archetype debuffs.

**Rank 2:** Debilitate. Ranged. Cost: 7 MP, 1 AP.  Use a status-inflicting ability on a single target that inflicts the status effect associated with your elemental type on a hit.

**Rank 3:** Slow. Ranged. Cost: 12 MP, 1 AP.  The target of this ability receives the Slowed status effect during the Effect Phase of this round. The effect then lasts for three subsequent rounds. While the target is Slowed, they have -1 AP to use per round.

**Rank 4:** Multidebuff. Multi. Cost: 12 MP, 1 AP.  Move all of your enemies down one level on the Bonus Tracker for the statistic that your archetype debuffs.

**Rank 5:** Vulnerability. Ranged. Cost: 8 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Vulnerable status on a single target.  When a target is Vulnerable, the next time they are hit by an attack of your base elemental type, it affects them as though they had a 2x weakness to that elemental type, and the Vulnerable status is removed.  Characters can be Vulnerable to multiple elemental types at a time.  If a character has a 2x or greater weakness to the elemental type it is Vulnerable to, the Vulnerable status does nothing.
