# Attributes and Statistics

The capabilities of a character during battle are represented by their attributes, their statistics, and their abilities.  Likewise, the abilities a player character can use are determined by the job they occupy and its current rank, their class, their items, their equipment, and whatever flex powers they have taken during character advancement.

A character's stamina in battle is represented by two scores, their _Hit Points_ and their _Mana Points._  Throughout these rules, these will be shortened to HP and MP, respectively.  When a character is hit with an ability that counts as a physical attack or magical attack, their HP is reduced by the calculated damage number.  When a character uses an ability that has an MP cost, their MP is reduced by that amount.  Characters may never use an ability that costs more than their current MP, and a character's MP and HP can never go below zero.  If a character's HP is reduced to zero, they are referred to as being downed.  A downed character cannot act and cannot be the target of more effects.  See the Death and Injury section for more details.

The core of a character's capabilities made up of their _attributes,_ which are three numbers from 1 to 10 that are measures of their relative aptitude in a particular domain of action.
*  A character's _Body_ is a measure of how adept they are at pushing their athletic abilities to the limit, from hand-eye coordination to endurance running.
*  A character's _Mind_ is a measure of how quick and able they are at intellectually challenging tasks, from logical debate to solving mathematical puzzles.
*  A character's _Spirit_ is a representation of their strength of personality.  This governs their aptitude for social interactions, as well as their ability to empathize with others.

In combat, a character's strengths and weaknesses are represented by 12 numbers known as their _statistics._  Each statistic is either tied to a pool that they lose or gain depending on the situation, or a number that determines the probability that different outcomes will occur when they use their abilities in conjunction with the statistics of other characters.
*  A character's _Initiative_ determines when they act in combat.  The higher their Initiative is, the sooner they act.  Their base Initiative is equal to their Mind times 2 plus the bonus they receive from their class at Tier 1.
*  A character's _Health_ is their base maximum HP during combat.  It is equal to their Body times 5 plus the bonus they receive from their class at Tier 1.

*  A character's _Evasion_ reduces the likelihood that they will be hit by either a physical or magical attack.  A character's base Evasion is equal to the bonus from their equipped accessories plus the bonus from their current job if their is one.
