# Character Creation

In Last Odyssey, each player has control of a single character.  In Last Odyssey, characters will travel the world, taking on quests, defeating monsters, and being a force for positive change.  As they continue on in the campaign, they will gain new abilities and increase their [attributes and statistics](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics).  The basic measure of a character's strength is a number called their _<dfn id="term-tier">tier</dfn>,_ which is a number of 1 to 10 that indicates how high the character's statistics and attributes will be, as well as how many abilities they have.  The following section outlines the process for making a new tier 1 character.  For characters beyond tier 1, see the [Character Advancement](../Characters/Character-Advancement) section.

## Create Character Concept
The first thing you should do before you write down any numbers is think a little bit about what kind of person your character is--their beliefs, their background, any quirks of appearance, and so on.  Write down a few sentences describing any details that immediately come to mind.  Once you've done this, there are two more parts to your character concept that you should decide on before moving forward.  The first of these is their _<dfn id="term-aspiration">Aspiration</dfn>,_ which is what drives them--what they want to accomplish, what kind of person they want to be, or what code of honor or ethics they follow.  The second of these is their _<dfn id="term-relationships">Relationships</dfn>,_ which are the people or groups to which they feel the strongest connection.  This could be anything from ethnic or religious affiliation to a character's family, their best friends, or their lovers.  Writing down Relationships with other player characters is also strongly encouraged.  A character starts with one to three Relationships and one Aspiration, although they can have as many Relationships as they like during the game.  Players will also change their characters' Relationships and Aspirations as the story progresses.  After you have written a sentence or two describing each, you have enough to count as a concept.  You should also begin to think about their name and what they might look like.

## Set Attributes
After you have made your character concept, the next step is to determine your character's attributes.  These will also determine their starting statistics.  In Last Odyssey, each player character has three of these:
*  A character's _[Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body)_ contributes to their Health, Physical Accuracy, and Status Accuracy.
*  A character's _[Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind)_ contributes to their Initiative, Magical Accuracy, and Physical Accuracy.
*  A character's _[Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit)_ contributes to their Mana, Status Accuracy, and Magical Accuracy.

At character creation, you may either set the value of all of your attributes to 2, or set one to 3, one to 2, and one to 1.

## Choose Archetype
Next, choose your character's archetype, which gives them extra abilities and talents that they can acquire as they level up, as well as bonuses to their statistics.  In Last Odyssey, there are nine archetypes in total:
*  _[Rangers](../Characters/Archetypes/Ranger)_ are heroes of exceptional focus.
*  _[Thieves](../Characters/Archetypes/Thief)_ are heroes of exceptional cunning.
*  _[Artificers](../Characters/Archetypes/Artificer)_ are heroes of exceptional knowledge.
*  _[Sages](../Characters/Archetypes/Sage)_ are heroes of exceptional wisdom.
*  _[Priests](../Characters/Archetypes/Priest)_ are heroes of exceptional compassion.
*  _[Dancers](../Characters/Archetypes/Dancer)_ are heroes of exceptional charm.
*  _[Knights](../Characters/Archetypes/Knight)_ are heroes of exceptional discipline.
*  _[Commanders](../Characters/Archetypes/Commander)_ are heroes of exceptional leadership.
*  _[Harlequins](../Characters/Archetypes/Harlequin)_ are heroes of exceptional daring.

At character creation, your archetype determines the following traits:
*  Armor Proficiency: A character's _<dfn id="term-armor-proficiency">armor proficiency</dfn>_ is what type of armor they can wear.  At character creation, your character starts with a Mundane piece of that type of armor equipped.
*  Weapon Proficiency: A character's _<dfn id="term-weapon-proficiency">weapon proficiency</dfn>_ is what type of weapon they can wield.  At character creation, your character starts with a Mundane version of that type of weapon equipped.  Make sure to note down what statistic your character's weapon gives them a bonus to in addition to Physical Attack and Magical Attack.
*  Buff: Archetype sets the statistic that the character buffs when they occupy the Support job.  Later on, they will also gain permanent bonuses to it as they advance in tier.
*  Debuff: This sets the statistic that the character debuffs when they occupy the Saboteur job.
*  Stat Bonuses: A character's archetype grants them fixed bonuses to their Health, Initiative, and Mana.

A character's archetype also provides them with a set of abilities they can use regardless of what job they occupy as well as a set of passive abilities called talents that they can acquire as they advance in tier.  At character creation, they begin with the ability to use their archetype's rank 1 ability.

Finally, before you move on you should give your character either a Lucky accessory or a Mystical accessory that has no attached upgrade that they can equip in their accessory slot.  A Lucky accessory gives them a +1 bonus to their Evasion, while a Mystical accessory gives them a +1 bonus to their Resistance.

## Choose Elemental Type
A character's elemental type determines the elemental type of some of the abilities they gain from their jobs.  More specifically, they determine the elemental type of the damage they deal with certain Striker and Caster abilities, the element of the Shells they apply and the damage they can immunize their party members from as a Support, and the status effect they can apply as a Saboteur.  The nine elements are Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Thunder, Ice, Wood, Light, and Shadow.  See the [Elemental Types](../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types) section of the Combat Rules for more details.

## Choose Starting Job
A character's job grants them abilities they can use in combat, and extra actions they can take during exploration.  It also grants them bonuses to three different statistics that depend on which job they currently occupy.  As they advance in Tier, characters will gain multiple jobs that they can switch between during the Paradigm Phase of combat.  Eventually, every character in the party will be able to use any job.  However, at character creation all characters start with only one job available.  See the [Jobs](../Characters/Jobs/) section for more details.  In Last Odyssey, there are six jobs:
*  _[Strikers](../Characters/Jobs/Striker)_ specialize in dealing physical damage to their enemies.
*  _[Casters](../Characters/Jobs/Caster)_ specialize in dealing magical damage to their enemies.
*  _[Healers](../Characters/Jobs/Healer)_ specialize in restoring their allies' HP and negating debuffs and status effects.
*  _[Defenders](../Characters/Jobs/Defender)_ specialize in drawing enemy attacks and negating the damage they do to allies.
*  _[Supports](../Characters/Jobs/Support)_ specialize in buffing allies and applying Shells, which are a form of temporary HP.
*  _[Saboteurs](../Characters/Jobs/Saboteur)_ specialize in debuffing and applying negative status effects to enemies.

When you choose your character's starting job, they automatically gain access to that job's Rank 1 ability, which you should mark down on your character sheet.

Each job grants extra bonuses to three different character statistics equal to their [Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body), [Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind), and [Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit) that are listed in their description in the Jobs section.  Whenever you take a new job, including now, you should note down the statistics that they give bonuses to.  When you calculate your statistics, you will take these into account.  Eventually, you will have separate sets of statistics listed for all six of your character's jobs.

## Calculate Statistics
At this point, you should now have enough information to determine your character's statistics.  Below, the formulae for determining each of them are given in shorthand.  To see them in more detail and learn more about what each statistic does, see the [Attributes and Statistics](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics) section as well as the [Combat Rules](../Combat-Rules/Combat).
*  _Health_ determines a character's maximum HP.  It is equal to ([Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body))x5 + (Archetype Bonus).
*  _Initiative_ determines when a character acts during combat.  It is equal to ([Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind))x2 + (Archetype Bonus).
*  _Mana_ determines a character's maximum MP.  It is equal to ([Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit))x5 + (Archetype Bonus).
*  _Physical Attack_ determines a character's base physical damage bonus.  It is equal to (Weapon Bonus) + (Job Bonus if applicable).
*  _Magical Attack_ determines a character's base magical damage bonus.  It is equal to (Weapon Bonus) + (Job Bonus if applicable).
*  _Physical Defense_ determines the base reduction to the physical damage a character takes.  It is equal to (Armor Bonus) + (Job Bonus if applicable).
*  _Magical Defense_ determines the base reduction to the magical damage a character takes.  It is equal to (Armor Bonus) + (Job Bonus if applicable).
*  _Evasion_ determines the base reduction to enemies' chance to hit a character when they attack.  It is equal to (Accessory Bonus if applicable) + (Job Bonus if applicable).
*  _Resistance_ determines the base reduction to enemies' chance to inflict a status effect on a character.  It is equal to (Accessory Bonus if applicable) + (Job Bonus if applicable).
*  _Physical Accuracy_ determines a character's bonus chance to hit with physical attacks.  It is equal to ([Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind)) + ([Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body)).
*  _Magical Accuracy_ determines a character's bonus chance to hit with magical attacks.  It is equal to ([Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit)) + ([Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind)).
*  _Status Accuracy_ determines a character's bonus chance to inflict status effects on enemies.  It is equal to ([Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body)) + ([Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit)).
*  _Carrying Capacity_ determines how many items you can hold in your inventory at once.  It is equal to 10 + ([Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body))x5.

## Create Eidolon
At this stage in the process, you should now be ready to create your character's eidolon.  An eidolon is a being whose appearance in the world is the most powerful manifestation of a character's magic.  Think of them as a combination between a patron saint and a guardian angel.  Each player character has a single eidolon that grows more powerful as they grow more powerful.  In combat, player characters can spend Anima to summon their eidolons.  See the Eidolons section for information on the rules for using them.

During character creation, you should record your character's eidolon's name, appearance,  and statistics.  Its statistics are determined by the formulae listed in the [Eidolons](../Characters/Eidolons) section.  The exception to this is that eidolons do not have Mana because their attacks are either free or have an Anima cost.  In addition, a character's eidolon has the same elemental type as their listed elemental type for the purposes of determining the outcomes of attacks and status-inflicting abilities that target them during battle.

Each eidolon has one of six possible archetypes: Striker, Caster, Healer, Defender, Support, or Saboteur.  All eidolons can use the Attack and Full Restore abilities, and also gains two more abilities depending on archetype.  See the Eidolons section for more details.
*  _[Strikers](../Characters/Jobs/Striker)_ gain the Cleave and Elemental Strike abilities.
*  _[Casters](../Characters/Jobs/Caster)_ gain the Magic Bolt and Elemental Bolt abilities.
*  _[Healers](../Characters/Jobs/Healer)_ gain the Heal and Cure abilities.
*  _[Defenders](../Characters/Jobs/Defender)_ gain the Shield and Barrier abilities.
*  _[Supports](../Characters/Jobs/Support)_ gain the Enhance and Shell abilities.
*  _[Saboteurs](../Characters/Jobs/Saboteur)_ gain the Reduce and Sabotage abilities.

## Finishing Touches
At this point in character creation, you have all of the necessary information required to play your character.  Make sure all of it is recorded properly on your character sheet.  In addition, be sure to write down any other relevant character information, such as their height, weight, gender, eye color, backstory, real and apparent age, and other story elements.  In addition, give your character 5 starting Anima.  They will earn more through Scenes over the course of the game.

Finally, all characters receive 10 cr at character creation.  Players may use some or all of this to purchase battle items.  Whatever amount is left over after they are done purchasing items is carried with them into the beginning of the game.  Talk with your GM and see the [Battle Items](../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory/Battle-Items) section to learn the kinds of items you might purchase in this manner.

Before you are finished with your character, you should check--have you:
1.  Given your character a name and appearance?
2.  Chosen your character's Aspiration and Relationships?
3.  Set your character's [Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body), [Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind), and [Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit)?
4.  Chosen your character's archetype, and recorded its rank 1 ability?
5.  Recorded your character's weapon proficiency and starting weapon?
6.  Recorded your character's armor proficiency and starting armor?
7.  Given your character either a Lucky or Mystical accessory?
8.  Recorded the buff and debuff associated with your character's archetype?
9.  Chosen your character's elemental type?
10.  Chosen your character's starting job, and recorded its rank 1 ability?
11.  Recorded the three bonuses to your character's statistics that their starting job provides?
12.  Calculated your character's Health, Initiative, Mana, Physical Attack, Magical Attack, Physical Defense, Magical Defense, Evasion, Resistance, Physical Accuracy, Magical Accuracy, Status Accuracy, and Carrying Capacity correctly according to the provided formulae?
13.  Recorded all of your Eidolon's statistics?
14.  Recorded your Eidolon's elemental type?
15.  Recorded your Eidolon's four abilities?
16.  Written down your Eidolon's name and appearance?
17.  Given your character 10 cr, and bought any items with it that you can afford?
18.  Given your character 5 starting Anima?

If you have done all of this, then congratulations, you are now ready to play Last Odyssey!
