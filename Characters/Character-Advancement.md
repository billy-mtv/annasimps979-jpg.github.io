# Character Advancement

Over time, characters in Last Odyssey will earn experience points, or XP for short.  The pool of XP that a character has earned can be spent on making them stronger by increasing their attributes and unlocking new abilities.  In Last Odyssey, a character's level of advancement in relation to other characters is quantified by its tier.  Characters of a given tier can spend XP on four distinct improvements to their character: unlocking a new job or unlocking a talent for one they already have, taking what's known as a flex power, adding 1 to one of their attributes, and advancing 3 Ranks in a job they are currently able to occupy.  The last two of these can be done twice per tier, while the first two can only be done once.

The XP cost of each improvement a character buys is equal to the number of improvements they have already bought plus one multiplied by twice their current tier.  For example, at tier 1 the very first improvement a character buys will cost 2 XP, while the last one will cost 12 XP.  Characters of tier 10 can buy improvements as normal, but are maxed out at tier 10.  If a character in your campaign reaches max level, this means that it's time for the campaign to start wrapping up and/or for that character to move on and be changed out for another one.  Every time you advance in tier, you also gain access to the archetype ability or stat bonus of the corresponding rank.

Advancement Checklist:
*  Advance 3 Ranks in a job.
*  Advance 3 Ranks in a job.
*  Advance a single attribute by 1.
*  Advance a different attribute by 1.
*  Unlock a new job or unlock a talent.
*  Learn a flew power.

## Advancing Attributes
When a player chooses to advance one of their character's attributes, they add +1 to either their Body, their Mind, or their Spirit.  The next time they take this improvement during the same tier, they must improve a different attribute.  The maximum value that any of a character's three attributes can have is 10.

## Advancing Jobs
When a player advances their character's Rank in a job, they are now able to use all of the abilities associated with that Rank or lower while they occupy it.  Players can save up Ranks whenever they take this improvement until they are ready, but they cannot spend them except when they take this improvement again.  Unlocking the capstone ability at the end of a job's ability list counts as advancing by 2 Ranks instead of 1.

## Unlocking Jobs and Talents
Every tier, players may either choose to give their character a talent or unlock a new job.  When a character unlocks a new job, they may now occupy it during combat and gain the associated exploration action during travel.  When they first unlock a job, it starts at rank 1.

Instead of unlocking a new job, a player can instead choose to unlock one of the talents listed in their archetype description.  Each talent is a passive ability that is only active when a character occupies the corresponding job.  There are six talents available to unlock per archetype, one for each job.

## Flex Powers
When a character takes this improvement, they gain an extra ability called a flex power that they can use regardless of what job they currently occupy.  You may take multiple of each variety of flex power.  However, you may only take one power of each elemental type or statistic of each of the four.  For example, a character could have Water Strike and Water Bolt, but could not have two Water Bolt abilities that were both flex powers.  Characters may, however, take the flex power versions of abilities that they also have access to in a particular job, so a character could have Water Bolt as a Caster ability and Water Bolt as a flex power.  They would simply only be able to use the flex power version of Water Bolt unless they were a Caster.  

During character advancement, players may purchase the following flex powers:
*  Flex Buff. Ally. Cost: 10 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose one of the nine character statistics.  Using this ability raises the specified statistic of the target by one level on the Bonus Tracker.
*  Flex Debuff. Ranged. Cost: 6 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose one of the nine character statistics.  Using this ability lowers the specified statistic of the target by one level on the Bonus Tracker.
*  Flex Bolt. Ranged. Cost: 10 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  Using this ability makes a magical attack of that elemental type against a single target.
*  Flex Strike. Melee. Cost: 10 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  Using this ability makes a physical attack of that elemental type against a single target.
*  Flex Debilitate. Ranged. Cost: 14 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose a status effect.  Using this ability triggers a status-inflicting ability against a single target that inflicts this status effect on a hit.
*  Flex Shell. Ally. Cost: 14 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  Using this ability increases the Shell of a single target by your current Magical Attack.  This power works the same as the Support's Shell ability.
*  Flex Protect. Ally. Cost: 18 MP, 1 AP.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  Using this ability makes you or a single ally Protected against that elemental type.
*  Flex Statistic. Passive.  You gain a permanent +5 bonus to your character's Health, +5 bonus to their Mana, or a +2 bonus to their Initiative.
*  Flex Proficiency. Passive.  You become proficient in a type of weapon or armor you were not previously proficient in.

## Advancing Tier
Once you have bought one of each of the six tier improvements, you are ready to increase your character's tier.  To do so, you must spend 3 Anima to either summon their eidolon in battle or spend Anima to save them from True Death.  Once this has been done, the character advances to the next tier.

## Changing Aspirations and Relationships
It is inevitable that a character's Aspirations and Relationships will change throughout the game.  When they use them to spend Anima, they will abandon or change them depending on the narrative.  In addition, whenever player determines that their character's Aspiration has changed and/or they have acquired or lost a Relationship, they have the ability to modify them at will.  They should then announce this to the group so that the other players and the GM can take proper note of the change.
