## Advancements by Rank

**Rank 1:** Scan. Ranged. Cost: 2 MP, 1 AP.  Select an enemy.  You immediately learn its current HP, MP, Shell, and elemental type.  Subsequent uses of this ability on the same enemy will allow you to learn the same information, or allow you to learn the value of one of its statistics, its item table, or reveal one of its abilities.

**Rank 2:** You gain +1 Magical Accuracy.

**Rank 3:** Item Specialist. Passive.  When you use an ability that costs MP, you may substitute the MP cost of the ability by expending an item whose effect is of the same type as the ability.

**Rank 4:** You gain +1 Magical Accuracy.

**Rank 5:** Multiscan. Multi. Cost: 10 MP, 1 AP.  Target all enemies.  You immediately learn their current HP, MP, Shell, and elemental type.  Subsequent uses of this ability on all enemies will allow you to learn the same information, or allow you to learn the value of one of their statistics, their item tables, or reveal one of the abilities of each one individually.

**Rank 6:** You gain +1 Magical Accuracy.

**Rank 7:** Reveal Weakness. Passive.  When you use the Scan ability on an enemy, it inflicts the Scanned status effect.  The next physical attack, magical attack, or status-inflicting ability that hits the enemy will ignore any resistances it has, and then the Scanned status effect is removed.

**Rank 8:** You gain +1 Magical Accuracy.

**Rank 9:** You gain +1 Magical Accuracy.

**Capstone:** Target Acquired. Multi. Cost: 1 Anima, 2 AP.  Use Scan on all enemies on the battlefield.  Every affected enemy will be Scanned for the remainder of the battle unless the effect is removed by an ability.

## Talents

**Striker:** Sniper.  When you use an item that does physical damage to an enemy, you may add your Physical Attack to its base damage.

**Caster:** Magic Ammo.  When you use an item that does magical damage to an enemy, you may add your Magical Attack to its base damage.

**Healer:** First Aid.  When you use an item that heals an ally, you may add your Magical Attack to its base healing.

**Defender:** Optimize Defenses.  If you use the Scan ability on an ally, it inflicts the Optimized status effect on them.  The next physical attack, magical attack, or status-inflicting ability that hits them will ignore any of their weaknesses.  The Optimized status effect is then removed.

**Support:** Targeting Systems.  When you use Scan on an ally, they gain a temporary +5 to their Physical, Magical, and Status Accuracies that does not count on the bonus tracker until the end of their next turn.

**Saboteur:** Monkeywrench.  When you use an item that inflicts a status effect on an enemy, you may subtract your Status Accuracy from the result on the hit die to determine if they are hit.
