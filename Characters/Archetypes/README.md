# Archetypes

Every player character has a single archetype that represents the essence of their heroism.  Each archetype is associated with a heroic virtue that has no mechanical effects but guides how a character behaves during the narrative.  At character creation, a character's archetype determines their armor and weapon proficiencies, which are the type of armor and the type of weapon that character can equip.  It also determines the statistic that their Buff abilities in the Support job increase, as well as the statistic that their Debuff abilities in the Saboteur job decrease, and gives a bonus to a character's Health, Mana, and Initiative.  As you increase your character's tier, their archetype will also provide abilities that can be used regardless of what job you currently occupy in combat.  During the later tiers, their archetype will also provide talents to choose from, which modify their existing abilities while they occupy the associated job.  At tier 10, instead of unlocking a normal combat ability, you unlock a capstone ability that your Eidolon can use when summoned.
