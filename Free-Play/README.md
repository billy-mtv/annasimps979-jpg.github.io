# Free Play

One of the cornerstones of FRP is _free play,_ a state of the game in which the actions players can take are not strictly delineated by the rules for system such as combat or the travel round, but rather determined by the context of the narrative and by the rulings made by the GM, and Last Odyssey is no different.  The following section is a guide to the mechanics and frameworks that exist in Last Odyssey that GMs can use to facilitate free play while following Last Odyssey's storytelling principles.
