# Settlements

All stories, at their core, are about people, and the stories you tell in Last Odyssey are no different.  For safety and because we are social animals, human beings will almost always be found together in settlements.  In Last Odyssey, a settlement is also a term that refers to a node or closely linked group of nodes where players can rest from traveling, buy goods and services, find information, and interact with NPCs who will advance the plot.  While in a settlement, players have the chance for both free play and structured investigation.  The following section presents tools for creating those aspects of settlements that players will find the most useful, namely resting accommodations and the gathering information, as well as a guide to creating settlements that closely fit the type of pattern that best facilitates the feeling of the Last Odyssey setting.

In Last Odyssey, settlements are rare, and large settlements are even rarer.  This is because the implied setting of the game is pre-industrial.  Travel is difficult and trade even moreso, resulting in a settlement pattern much like that of the postclassical era of human history.  When creating a new settlement in the overworld, GMs should take into consideration its population, which is a number that determines a great deal about the settlement, including its layout, its culture, and its architecture.  GMs are allowed and encouraged to break the mold, but the following section will focus on the major types of settlements that players will usually encounter.

Not every settlement or landmark in a given region needs to be counted in the overworld.  The reason for this is that not every place in the world will ever be relevant to the campaign.  Instead, the GM should focus on detailing settlements that meet one or more of the following criteria:
*  The settlement provides goods and services the players will be interested in buying.
*  The settlement is a place where players can offload goods in exchange for currrency.
*  The settlement is a place to rest on the way to somewhere more important.
*  The settlement has employment for adventurers, or is the destination of a given quest.
*  The settlement has Lore the players can learn by exploring it.
